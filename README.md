<h2>Black Hole simulation in C++</h2>
--ACTIVE--

<p>This project is my shot at simulating a black hole in C++ using ray-tracing to visualize their effects on light, and impacts on surrounding visuals.</p>

This project begins with re-learning C++ after some time away, learning how to use OpenGl, GLFW, glad, and glm.
I am excited to work on this project with the end goal I have set, despite having a long road ahead before I can even begin touching any of the math involving black holes.

Currently I am in the process of learning OpenGL and related libraries, before begining the real work of simulating a black hole.
